# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C programming language for two players.

## How to Play

1. **Compile**: Compile the source code using a C compiler. For example, using GCC:
    ```
    gcc -o tic_tac_toe tic_tac_toe.c
    ```

2. **Run**: Execute the compiled program:
    ```
    ./tic_tac_toe
    ```

3. **Gameplay**: Follow the prompts to play the game. Players take turns to place their marks (X or O) on the 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

4. **Input Format**: Players input their moves by specifying the row and column numbers of the grid where they want to place their mark. Rows and columns are numbered from 1 to 3.

5. **Winning Condition**: The game will automatically detect when a player has won or if the game ends in a draw.

6. **Play Again**: After the game ends, players have the option to play again or exit the program.
